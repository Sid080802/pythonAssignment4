# Python Assignment Solutions

This repository contains solutions to six basic Python programming assignments. These assignments cover fundamental concepts in Python, such as loops, recursion, and mathematical computations. Below is a brief description of each assignment:

## Assignment Questions

1. **Factorial of a Number**  
   Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

2. **Multiplication Table**  
   Write a Python program to display the multiplication table for any given number. This program generates the table by multiplying the input number with numbers 1 through 10.

3. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
   Write a Python program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

4. **Armstrong Number Check**  
   Write a Python program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

5. **Sum of Natural Numbers**  
   Write a Python program to find the sum of natural numbers up to a given number. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula `n(n+1)/2`.
